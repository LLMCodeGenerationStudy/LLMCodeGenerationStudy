# Prompt Design

To ensure experimental consistency across various LLMs, we employed a standardized prompt format, as outlined in an existing study [1].
Notably, our prompts excluded library import information, necessitating that the models autonomously identify and import the required libraries for the APIs utilized.

## Prompt
```
Please provide a self-contained Python script that solves the following problem in a markdown code block:
